Crestron control for Disco music and Disco ball with lights with 1 button press
This is a project me and my wife came up with.

The Idea: She would play disco music while she cooked if she was feeling depressed. "It's hard to be sad with Disco music" she said.
Wouldn't it be fun to have a single button that played disco music, turned on a mirror ball and lights. It would be like having an instant happy button.
On remodeling our kitchen, I thought this through and realized I could do this.

This is based on Crestron, so at its basic it is in C.
One can use a Gen 2 processor and you do not need a touchscreen.
For the one button press this uses CEN-RFGW-EX to communicate to a CEN-GWEXER button.

Economy of Means:
This is made of consummer and recycled parts. There is nothing commercial about this.
I initually used the amplifier I had, it can be powered by a 120 volt relay.
This one now has 2 Clearone Converge 880TA's. A discontinued generation 1 product. They do have 4 amps inside each one that can be 8 ohm or 70 volt. Being controlled via IP/TCP makes it a little easier.
The MP3 player is an IR controlled SD card reader.
