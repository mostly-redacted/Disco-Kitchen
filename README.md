Crestron control for Disco music and Disco ball with lights with 1 button press
This is a project me and my wife came up with.
The Idea: She would play disco music while she cooked if she was feeling depressed. "It's hard to be sad with Disco music" she said.
Wouldn't it be fun to have a single button that played disco music, turned on a mirror ball and lights. It would be like an instant happy button.
On remodeling our kitchen, I thought this through and realized I could do this.
